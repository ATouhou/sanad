Supervised Authenticity Preservation Assistant

## Use Case

Initial use case is for [preservation of Quranic verses and Islamic hadiths](http://hendyirawan.tumblr.com/post/92964403911/sanad).
However, the platform is sufficiently generic for preservation of general textual content in multiple languages with Unicode encoding.

## Planned

1. Firefox add-on
2. Java API service and web-based UI
3. Chrome extension
4. Firefox for Android add-on
5. Facebook application that can annotate posts and comments, and comment with annotations on posts
