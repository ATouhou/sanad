Supervised Authenticity Preservation Assistant

## Use Case

Initial use case is for [preservation of Quranic verses and Islamic hadiths](http://hendyirawan.tumblr.com/post/92964403911/sanad).
However, the platform is sufficiently generic for preservation of general textual content in multiple languages with Unicode encoding.
